####Dependencies

External dependencies are managed quickly and easily with Bower. Simply:

3. Add references within your HTML, and you are all set.

*Note: If required, run `npm install -g bower` first to install bower.*

####Development

Development is quick and easy thanks to Grunt. Simply:

+ Run `grunt` to build the project with your updates included, or
